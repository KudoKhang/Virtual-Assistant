![Bot: Virtual Assistant by Python](https://i.imgur.com/U770uCr.jpg)
# Virtual Assistant

Virtual Assistant is a tool that helps us automate commonly used operations with pre-set commands. It will be very convenient and fast for users.

# How it works

The virtual assistant will recognize the voice ( [Speech Recognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition) ) and then convert it into commands, process and output the results you want by voice ( [pyttsx3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/) ). In case the bot does not recognize the voice, you can directly write the command

**The Assistant can** :
- *Open application in computer*
- *Open music, movie*
- *Search in google and Youtube*
- *Update covid-19 in the world*
- *Send message ( will be in the next version )*


# Installation

This package can be installed from [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ChatterBot) by running:

```
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install win10toast
pip install pyttsx3
pip install pyaudio
```
*[pyaudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio) is dependent of speech recognition package*

# Usage
Open cmd in folder Virtual-Assistant: 

```
python app.py
```
